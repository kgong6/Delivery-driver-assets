# Delivery-driver-assets
Progress log for pixel art assets for my Unity delivery driver game.

I didn't know I was meant to keep a Github repo until 16 hours in (started this project three days before when I wrote this on 22/07/2024) working towards completing all assets for my delivery driver game. I know that's not good enough and I apologise for this mistake and will maintain this repo from now on. Here is my progress log:

This log tracks my progress from not having any experience in pixel art to finishing the assets for my delivery driver game. All pixel art is completed in LibreSprite.

## 1st hour - Delivery driver - Starting my assets for the game
I initially decided to make a more realistic game being a modern delivery driver: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e0032b4-febd-43fe-ba3a-95d0dca9cd83) It was meant to be some comment of society, bla bla bla.

## 2nd hour - Delivery driver cont.
Here it is finished :   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4783f645-f437-49c7-a145-d5e81da3b38a)

## 3rd hour - but I changed the theme to something more light-hearted and fun. -- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5570c46-c205-46f5-83c0-bd1ab5ff558c) This drawing is on a 32px x 32px canvas, whereas my previous delivery driver was on a 64 px x 64px canvas (more realistic) . The smaller canvas allows for a fun and blocky sprite/asset. 

## 4th hour - road curves assets

These road curves are simple. I took time to make sure the curves looked completely smooth and symmetrical.

## 5th hour - cont.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e6513b9-0b8e-47ab-940e-a7945dfc25bb)

Improved cleaner version ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a05ed5-7cb9-4843-b3b6-41a775908126)

For some road curves, I struggled with keeping the road width consistent - because I had to rely on Libresprites circle tool so much. So I manually fixed it.

## 6th hour - cont.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1af82c1-c30f-4104-9733-92e42f104b5c) -- this curve was a struggle to keep the middle a consistent width. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23e2ed47-f7c7-457b-b7cc-12a6ec8af72c) 
At the time, I didn't know how to rotate the canvas and rotating the art messed up the edges of the curve so I just redrew the entire thing. Which is silly in hindsight because those two curves are almost identical - I could've saved so much time :(.


## 7th hour - cont.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85a42ad6-401b-483d-b01e-baba5a9478e7) Intersections! Were a bit of a struggle but the road shape is convincing enough.

## 8th hour - cont.
Final few straights of varying lengths finished, and also a roundabout intersection. I debated on whether to include a concrete road like bridge (as I want the roads to merge with bridges to be consistent), but I decided on including a wooden bridge. I just started it.

Also the widths of the previous roads were off by a few pixels, so I prevented more mistakes in the future that by going back to all the roads and editing a few pixels.

## 9th hour - Bridge finished and my first tileset.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/710ad58b-d69d-42c1-85ed-9a8954b5310b) - Finished! The wood grain on the planks was time consuming but look convincing if they aren't focused on.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55786f87-c636-4e52-bb73-2064c53cc0f1) - super simple but got me to understand how tilesets work.

## 10th hour - grass tileset asset 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bcd1ed9-acb5-47f8-ade0-6f0bf1c01dbe) - getting the colours right was difficult - I played around with many different hues and saturations in the grass shadows/highlights.

## 11th hour - cont.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ec8be1-4cce-4b98-ba12-ccd911ee7061) Thought I was finished at hour 14 but it looked strange without more grass patterns I tried to save it by adding sublte grass patterns.

## 12th hour - water tileset.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65352518-dde5-4e52-9898-6b960bb105ce) - simple, just modified the grass tileset, and chose a turqiouse colour. I also expanded the size of the water square in the center.

I also made a log that was 32px by 32px large - it was made with the circle tool - but looked unnatural, but then I resized the log to 16 by 16 pixels and changed canvas size. And the resize tool achieved the look I wanted for this asset. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/993ba635-ee28-403c-8491-5c0e15a1cc23)

## 13th hour - bushes
Little bush -- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57658d4f-ac5e-4b1c-b3b0-a3492274d5f1) - using all the tools in Libresprite, lumpy sphere, but still convincing and organic looking.

## 14th hour - tree?
Looks less convincing, struggled with colour and you can sorta tell -- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8716e2f7-0c38-429b-bc0e-8c110e145492) -- at the time, it reminded me more of the top of a tree, so it will be a tree asset.

## 15th hour - Glossy plant 
Had a few of the same problems as the last hour, but still doesn't look too bad :D. - the glossyness of the plant contrasts with the previous plants.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aded4cc-a9f4-4a7a-a45c-afb1974548f3)

## 16th hour - House 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b616e7dd-88e2-463c-9ba8-62b8a6f0e7c4)
Top down perspective was difficult. Colours were poorly done - some shadows were unsaturated and the hues of other shadows were too strong ie. Purplish shadow on roof.

## 17th hour - Houses cont.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6686a53b-f451-47aa-b1c8-e62790c8dc75) - 

Fixed perspective by resizing parts - resulted in the roof being uneven :( but fixed the colours.

## 18th hour Houses cont.
